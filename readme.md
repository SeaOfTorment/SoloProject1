# Planned features:
- [ ] Make a system for ability attributes - refer to Ability details for more info

- [ ] Add smoothing to player position/rotation

- [ ] Think of how abilities can be switched (hotbar like minecraft? like league? like elden ring?)

- [ ] Make new map

- [ ] Make interactables on map (explosive barrels, buffs, maybe takes some ideas from The Finals?)

- [ ] Add mana system

- [ ] Intergrate way of getting abilities (more info on Ability aquisition)

- [ ] Make environmental hazards (water = insta death?, spikes, etc)

- [ ] Make respawn system

- [ ] Find a way to add a texture overlay on existing material (like bullet hole, burn mark on wall)


## Ability details 
Everything will be in components, the planner will have the ability to adjust
the nature and behavior of their abilities, they'll be like building blocks.
It will consist mainly of a few types, for projectiles it's:
cast, travel, end.

you can choose components in cast such as:
Homing - ability will become homing and will trail enemy for x seconds then go rougue
Cone blast - deal extra damage in front of you in a cone shape
Clone - Clone original ability and shoot it alongside the original, deals only fraction of dmg

components for travel can be:
Speed trail - an effect like Nocturne's q, makes a trail where the projectile travels, gives ms boost
Eruption - make a trail along the ground where the projectile travels, making an eruption of lava (slow, dmg)
grass trail - much like the others, turns you invis if you go in it (like qiyanna)

components for end can be:
shockwave - creates a shockwave when colliding/ending spell, extra dmg
guiser - creates a guiser that knocks up, and slows anyone who gets caught
pool - creates a circle of healing that can heal when inside the zone, can only heal for half the dmg done


## Ability aquisition
(still thinking)


## Possible Features
- A system of 4 different elemental types; each with their own special effect. ie. fire would be
  extra damage, water would be slows, air would be utility, and earth would be defense/terrain
  modification.

- Gragas ult for an air ability where there will be knockback or can be used to knockback the user
  towards a direction like junkrat, ziggs, raze.

- There will be upgraded versions of the based element spell and the player will be able to put
  points into specific elements that they will use in the game. The game will be balanced by setting
  a flat amount of points available to each player and the player will have the freedom to choose
  the focused abilities that they have.

Each client has a clone of your character, just as you have a clone of each client's characters, I refer to them as mirrors (my mirror is their copy of my character)

I discovered that when I do rcp(function) it doesn't get sent to just your mirror, as I previously thought - It goes to ALL entities with the same script, this includes the non-mirrors such as enemy character.

Ending today (3:34 AM EST) 01/04/2024 - I think theres some extra stuff happening in the background I'm not aware of, and is influencing the behavior of my replication system, i'll investigate later today when I wake up!
